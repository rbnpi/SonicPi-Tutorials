         README for Purcell Funeral Music for Queen Mary
The Sonic Pi program PurcellFuneralMusic.txt requires
an audio sample file d1.wav to be installed before it
will work. The file is shown separately here. The easiest way
to download and install it is to download the zip file
SonicPiPurcell.zip from this repository.
The zip file contains the program file, a samples folder
containing d1.wav and a README file containing installation notes.
